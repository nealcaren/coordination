## Final Label Mapping (Canonical)

This should be treated as **authoritative** throughout the system.

* **Contribute (C)** = former **Y**
* **Protect (P)** = former **X**

Use **C/P everywhere**—UI, logs, dashboard, exports—never X/Y internally or externally once implemented. That consistency matters.

---

## Student-Facing Language (Minimal, Neutral)

### Decision Screen (Mobile)

Buttons:

* **Contribute (C)**
* **Protect (P)**

No definitions. No hints.
Just:

> “Choose one each round.”

This preserves ambiguity and lets meaning emerge socially.

---

### Round Results Screen

Show **only group pattern**, per your decision:

* “Group outcome: **3 Contribute / 1 Protect**”
* “Your points this round: +2”
* “Your total: 7”

Do **not** show who did what.

---

## Instructor Dashboard Language (Projected)

Replace all X/Y language with sociological phrasing:

### Core Metrics

* **% Contribute by Round**
* **% Protect by Round**
* **Group outcome patterns**

  * 4 Contribute
  * 3 Contribute / 1 Protect
  * 2 / 2
  * 1 / 3
  * 4 Protect

### Benchmarks

* **All-Contribute benchmark (per group): 76**
* **Observed average group total**
* **Median group total**

This makes the micro–macro contrast instantly visible.

## How This Pays Off Sociologically (For You)

These labels let you ask *better questions* in debrief:

* “When did people stop **contributing** and start **protecting**?”
* “What made protection feel necessary?”
* “Did anyone feel punished for contributing?”
* “Did protection become contagious?”
* “Was protection an individual choice—or a response to the situation?”

Importantly, **Protect** sounds *reasonable*, not antisocial.
Students can defend it without shame—which is exactly what you want.

---

## Bonus: One-Sentence Pre-Game Framing (Optional)

If you want *just enough* framing without biasing play:

> “In each round, you’ll choose whether to **Contribute** or **Protect**. Your outcome depends on what everyone does.”

Stop there.

---

## Post-Game Reveal (Very Effective)

After the game ends, you can say:

> “What you just played is a classic collective action problem.
> *Contribute* creates value at the group level.
> *Protect* reduces personal risk—but when everyone does it, everyone loses.”

At that point, you can connect directly to:

* public goods
* free riding
* trust
* norm breakdown
* anomie
* real-world analogs (taxes, unions, climate, group projects)
