## Win As Much As You Can (Online)

**A Micro-Simulation of Trust, Norms, and Social Order**

### What This Exercise Is

*Win As Much As You Can* is an interactive, eight-round social simulation in which students are randomly assigned to groups of four and must repeatedly choose between two actions—X or Y—without knowing in advance what the others will do. Each choice produces payoffs that depend not only on the individual’s decision, but on the pattern of decisions made by the group as a whole.

On the surface, the exercise resembles a game-theoretic dilemma. Sociologically, however, it functions as a **compressed laboratory for observing how social order emerges—or collapses—under conditions of uncertainty, weak enforcement, and repeated interaction**.

## Why This Is a Sociology Exercise (Not Just a Game)

The simulation is designed to foreground **social processes**, not optimal strategies.

Students are not told to cooperate or compete. They are simply placed in a situation where:

* individual incentives are misaligned with collective outcomes,
* communication is limited,
* trust must be inferred from behavior rather than promises,
* and reputations form quickly despite minimal information.

What unfolds mirrors many core sociological dynamics.

## Key Sociological Phenomena the Game Reveals

### 1. The Tension Between Individual Rationality and Collective Outcomes

Across eight rounds, students quickly discover that decisions that appear sensible at the individual level often produce poor outcomes for the group—and eventually for themselves. This illustrates a foundational sociological insight: **social outcomes cannot be reduced to individual intentions**.

Even when everyone would benefit from mutual cooperation, fear, uncertainty, and prior experience can prevent it from emerging.

---

### 2. Trust as a Social Structure

Trust in this exercise is not a personality trait; it is **socially produced**.

Students must decide:

* whether early cooperative actions signal good faith or strategic deception,
* how much weight to give to past behavior,
* and whether trust, once broken, can be rebuilt.

The game makes visible how fragile trust is, how costly it is to lose, and how unevenly it is distributed within groups.

---

### 3. Norm Formation and Breakdown

Over repeated rounds, some groups develop informal norms:

* “We always play Y.”
* “We punish X-players.”
* “We cooperate except in the final round.”

Other groups never stabilize, cycling through mistrust and retaliation. Students experience firsthand how **norms require shared expectations**, not just shared interests—and how easily ambiguity or misunderstanding can undermine them.

---

### 4. Reputation and Informal Social Control

Because groups remain together across rounds, individual actions accumulate meaning. Players acquire reputations: “trustworthy,” “opportunistic,” “unreliable.”

These reputations shape how others respond—often more strongly than formal rules. This allows instructors to discuss **informal sanctions, labeling, and moral judgment** as mechanisms of social control.

---

### 5. Inequality, Timing, and Power

The simulation includes bonus rounds with higher stakes. These moments reveal how:

* early advantages compound,
* inequality changes the feasibility of cooperation,
* and moral expectations intensify when more is at stake.

Students see that cooperation is not simply about goodwill—it is shaped by **relative position, timing, and leverage**.

---

## What the Aggregated Class Data Adds

Because the game runs simultaneously across the class, instructors can project live, aggregated statistics:

* How often students choose X vs Y by round
* Whether cooperation rises or falls as stakes increase
* How group outcomes compare to a fully cooperative benchmark
* How much variation exists across groups under identical rules

This allows students to move from **personal experience** to **structural analysis**—a core move in sociological thinking.

The class can ask not just:

> “What did my group do?”
> but
> “What patterns emerged across the system?”

---

## How This Fits into Core Sociology Themes

This exercise integrates naturally with discussions of:

* social order and anomie
* rationality and its limits
* trust, norms, and institutions
* collective action problems
* inequality and power
* micro–macro linkages

It works especially well early in the semester, when students are learning to think sociologically, but it can also anchor later discussions of theory, organizations, or political sociology.

## What Students Learn (Without Being Told)

By the end of the exercise, students typically realize:

* Cooperation is not simply a moral choice—it is a social achievement.
* Self-interest does not operate in a vacuum.
* Repeated interaction transforms incentives.
* Social systems can trap individuals into outcomes no one wants.

In short, the game does what good sociology does:
it **makes the invisible social forces shaping individual action visible—and hard to ignore**.
